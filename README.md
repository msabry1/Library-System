## Code Structure

The code is structured into three main components:

1. **User Struct**
   - Represents a library user with a name, user ID, and a set of borrowed books.
   - Provides methods to read user information, check if a book is borrowed by the user, borrow a book, and return a borrowed book.

2. **Book Struct**
   - Represents a book in the library with a name, book ID, quantity, and the number of borrowed copies.
   - Provides methods to read book information, check if a book name is a prefix of the book's name, return a book, check if a book is borrowable, and borrow a book.

3. **LibrarySystem Struct**
   - Manages the library system, including collections of users and books.
   - Provides methods to add users and books, find users and books by name, borrow and return books, search for books by prefix, and print various library-related information.
   - Includes a menu-driven interface to interact with the library system.

## Advantages of the Library Management System

The library management system provides several advantages:

1. **Efficient Book Management:** The system allows librarians to efficiently manage books in the library. They can add books with relevant information such as book name, ID, and quantity, making it easy to track available copies.

2. **User Management:** Users can be added to the system with unique IDs, simplifying the process of tracking borrowed books and managing user accounts.

3. **Book Borrowing and Returning:** Users can borrow books by specifying their name and the book they want to borrow. The system ensures that users can only borrow books if copies are available. This functionality streamlines the borrowing process.

4. **Search and Retrieval:** The system allows users to search for books by providing a prefix of the book's name. This feature assists users in finding specific books quickly and easily.

5. **Borrowed Book Tracking:** The system tracks which users have borrowed which books. This information is essential for maintaining the library's records and ensuring timely returns.

6. **Sorting and Printing:** The system offers options to print lists of users and books, sorted by ID or name. This feature facilitates library organization and inventory management.

7. **User-Friendly Interface:** The menu-driven interface makes it user-friendly, allowing both librarians and users to interact with the system intuitively.

8. **Error Handling:** The system incorporates basic error handling, such as checking for duplicate users and books and ensuring that users can only borrow available copies of books.


Overall, the library management system enhances the efficiency of library operations, improves book and user tracking. It can be customized and expanded to meet the specific needs of different libraries and institutions.
